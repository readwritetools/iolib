<table>
	<tr><th>Abstract</th></tr>
	<tr><td>The <span class=product>iolib</span> JavaScript library has functions for handling line-by-line text I/O, block-oriented binary I/O, and filesystem operations.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

Reading and writing text files using line-oriented functions is a common need.
Handling block transfers of binary data is necessary for packed data formats.

Performing basic filesystem operations complements these two.

### Features

The `TextReader` class has a UTF-8 aware `getline` method for parsing a text file
one line at a time.

The `TextWriter` class has `putline` and `puts` methods to serialize to a text file.

The lower level `BinaryReader` reads a block of 8192 bytes, advancing the buffer
pointer with each read.

The `BinaryWriter` class has methods for writing Strings, Buffers, 4-bytes,
2-bytes, and 1-byte .

The `Pfile` class has methods for checking if a file exists; if it's a directory
or a symlink; if it's readable, writable, executable; and for assembling and
accessing parts of a file's path, basename, and extension.

### Installation

The <span>iolib</span> library may be installed directly from github or via
NPM.

```bash
[user@host]# npm install iolib
```

Sample usage of the libary in a node.js project:

```javascript
import {TextReader} from 'iolib';    
import {TextWriter} from 'iolib';    
import {BinaryReader} from 'iolib';    
import {BinaryWriter} from 'iolib';    
import {Pfile} from 'iolib';    
```
